We know that we should expect things in a relative order

Units with at least 3 PPC's
Mechs with 3 or more PPC's
Mechs with 3 PPC's and a small laser or LRM's


[Optional] UNIT + CHUNK + [Optional] CHUNK...

UNIT: any unit type. And if one isn't provided we just assume that it is everything

CHUNK: QUANTITY + EQUIPMENT

QUANTITY: Dont forget

EQUIPMENT: Ideally we could get this from the database... And that might be doable but not sure yet



MEDIUM_LASER: [medium laser | ml]
LARGE_LASER:  [large laser | ll]
